"\n"
"ExUnit supports the following options:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:assert_receive_timeout` - the timeout to be used on `assert_receive`\n"
"    calls. Defaults to 100ms.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:capture_log` - if ExUnit should default to keeping track of log messages\n"
"    and print them on test failure. Can be overriden for individual tests via\n"
"    `@tag capture_log: false`. Defaults to `false`.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:colors` - a keyword list of colors to be used by some formatters.\n"
"    The only option so far is `[enabled: boolean]` which defaults to `IO.ANSI.enabled?/0`\n"
"\n"
"  * `:formatters` - the formatters that will print results;\n"
"    defaults to `[ExUnit.CLIFormatter]`\n"
"\n"
"  * `:max_cases` - maximum number of cases to run in parallel;\n"
"    defaults to `:erlang.system_info(:schedulers_online)`\n"
"\n"
"  * `:trace` - set ExUnit into trace mode, this sets `:max_cases` to `1` and\n"
"    prints each test case and test while running\n"
"\n"
"  * `:autorun` - if ExUnit should run by default on exit; defaults to `true`\n"
"\n"
"  * `:include` - specify which tests are run by skipping tests that do not\n"
"    match the filter\n"
"\n"
"  * `:exclude` - specify which tests are run by skipping tests that match the\n"
"    filter\n"

"  * `:refute_receive_timeout` - the timeout to be used on `refute_receive`\n"
"    calls (defaults to 100ms)\n"
"\n"
"  * `:seed` - an integer seed value to randomize the test suite\n"
"\n"
"  * `:stacktrace_depth` - configures the stacktrace depth to be used\n"
"    on formatting and reporters (defaults to 20)\n"
"\n"
"  * `:timeout` - set the timeout for the tests (default 60_000ms)\n"

"Basic unit testing framework for Elixir.\n"
"\n"
"## Example\n"
"\n"
"A basic setup for ExUnit is shown below:\n"
"\n"
"    # File: assertion_test.exs\n"
"\n"
"    # 1) Start ExUnit.\n"
"    ExUnit.start\n"
"\n"
"    # 2) Create a new test module (test case) and use \"ExUnit.Case\".\n"
"    defmodule AssertionTest do\n"
"      # 3) Notice we pass \"async: true\", this runs the test case\n"
"      #    concurrently with other test cases\n"
"      use ExUnit.Case, async: true\n"
"\n"
"      # 4) Use the \"test\" macro instead of \"def\" for clarity.\n"
"      test \"the truth\" do\n"
"        assert true\n"
"      end\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"To run the tests above, run the file using `elixir` from the\n"
"command line. Assuming you named the file `assertion_test.exs`,\n"
"you can run it as:\n"
"\n"
"    elixir assertion_test.exs\n"
"\n"
"## Case, Callbacks and Assertions\n"
"\n"
"See `ExUnit.Case` and `ExUnit.Callbacks`\n"
"for more information about defining test cases.\n"
"\n"
"The `ExUnit.Assertions` module contains\n"
"a set of macros to easily generate assertions with appropriate\n"
"error messages.\n"
"\n"
"## Integration with Mix\n"
"\n"
"Mix is the project management and build tool for Elixir. Invoking `mix test`\n"
"from the command line will run the tests in each file matching the pattern\n"
"`*_test.exs` found in the `test` directory of your project.\n"
"\n"
"You must create a `test_helper.exs` file inside the\n"
"`test` directory and put the code common to all tests there.\n"
"\n"
"The minimum example of a `test_helper.exs` file would be:\n"
"\n"
"    # test/test_helper.exs\n"
"    ExUnit.start\n"
"\n"
"Mix will load the `test_helper.exs` file before executing the tests.\n"
"It is not necessary to `require` the `test_helper.exs` file in your test\n"
"files. See `Mix.Tasks.Test` for more information.\n"
